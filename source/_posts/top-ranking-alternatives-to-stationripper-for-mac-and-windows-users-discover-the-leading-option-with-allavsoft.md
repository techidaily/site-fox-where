### Overview

StationRipper is a Microsoft Windows software which has the ability in recording online radios and downloading podcasts. However, if you google, you will find many users are posting to complain about the limitations of StationRipper and also ask for a StationRipper alternative. Before introducing the best StationRipper alternative, the following just lists some StationRipper limitations quoted from Google forums:

* StationRipper works fine on my Windows 2003, and now I also get a Mac. I tried many times to install StationRipper on my Mac, but I can not find a Mac version. Doesn't StationRipper have a Mac version?
* I try to use StationRipper to record some Pandora radios, but when I open StationRipper, it does not allow me to access anything. What should I do?
* I have clicked the Record button to record one online radio, but after a little longer, I still do not get any recorded radio. What is the problem?
* I get poor recorded radio quality and how I can get better quality from StationRipper?
