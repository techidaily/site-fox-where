## Top Ranking Alternatives to StationRipper for Mac & Windows Users: Discover the Leading Option with Allavsoft

### Overview

StationRipper is a Microsoft Windows software which has the ability in recording online radios and downloading podcasts. However, if you google, you will find many users are posting to complain about the limitations of StationRipper and also ask for a StationRipper alternative. Before introducing the best StationRipper alternative, the following just lists some StationRipper limitations quoted from Google forums:

* StationRipper works fine on my Windows 2003, and now I also get a Mac. I tried many times to install StationRipper on my Mac, but I can not find a Mac version. Doesn't StationRipper have a Mac version?
* I try to use StationRipper to record some Pandora radios, but when I open StationRipper, it does not allow me to access anything. What should I do?
* I have clicked the Record button to record one online radio, but after a little longer, I still do not get any recorded radio. What is the problem?
* I get poor recorded radio quality and how I can get better quality from StationRipper?
* I failed to download the podcasts with StationRipper. Why and how to fix this?

Actually, StationRipper only works on windows (95-XP/2003) and you will fail to install StationRipper on other Windows versions and Mac versions. Besides, StationRipper supports limited radio websites and can only download valid podcasts from its supported podcast websites. So if you can not install StationRipper on your Windows or Mac, failed to download StationRipper radios or podcasts or are not satisfied with the recorded radios or podcast qualities, you can try a StationRipper alternative - Allavsoft.
