There are several options on an excellent anti-malware. Sometimes, it becomes overwhelming to choose which one is the best. Anti-malware applications also have different ways of protecting your computer. In this article, we’ll look at two popular security programs: [Hitman Pro](https://www.hitmanpro.com/en-us/hmp.aspx) and [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/).

## Comparing Hitman Pro Vs Malwarebytes

### The Installation

Malwarebytes clocks in at around 80MB while Hitman Pro is about 10MB. Not an issue of a right DSL connection, but it does make a difference in the limited internet or when using data. However, the small size of Hitman Pro is caused by its process of protection discussed below.

Installation of both programs is straightforward and easy. It is good to note that there are no unnecessary applications bundled during installation.

Malwarebytes needs to be installed on your system to run. On the other hand, Hitman Pro comes in both standard installation and portable app. That means you have the option to use the mobile version without installing it. It proves advantageous when your computer has any malware which blocks the installation of security programs.

### Features

Both Hitman Pro and Malwarebytes complement any primary, full-suite security applications. They run on most Windows systems. The apps also offer trials and varying limited functions in their free versions.

Hitman Pro, along with its separate real-time protection Hitman.Alert, uses cloud technology to scan and identify threats on your computer. It uploads suspicious files in its servers and uses scan engines like Emsisoft, PrevX, Dr. Web, G Data and Ikarus to identify malware.

Which means, it needs an Internet connection to work. Contrary to Hitman Pro, Malwarebytes provides on-demand malware detection even without Internet connection. It uses its database to identify threats to your system. You will only need Internet when updating its definition files.

> The two anti-malware offer more features in their premium version. Malwarebytes Premium protects your system in real-time. It also has anti-exploit and anti-ransomware features. During web browsing, its website protection alerts you when a website contains malicious web pages.

It also has anti-rootkit removal and repair capabilities. Meanwhile, the paid version of Hitman Pro only offers advanced malware removal and potentially unwanted application (PUA) removal. You will need to purchase the standalone HitmanPro.Alert for more real-time features.

HitmanPro.Alert protects your system from new and developing malware, including ransomware. It also blocks phishing attacks and questionable websites. Additionally, it has online banking protection which is certified by MRG Effitas. It also prevents hacking on your webcam, microphone, and keystrokes. For some, this might be a good reason to pay the additional $34.95 on top of the standard version of Hitman Pro.

### User Interface

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Hitman Pro and Malwarebytes have different approaches in their user interface. Malwarebytes employs the traditional tabbed window. Each tab corresponds to an action or report. It also shows your protection status on the Dashboard. It makes it easy to see what is going on your system. During active scanning, Malwarebytes shows you which part of your computer it is scanning for threats.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1-2.png)

Hitman Pro has a minimalist user interface. You will see a simple window with three buttons (excluding the Buy Now button) upon execution of the application. Scanning is just a matter of clicking Next. You can find the settings and other functions in another window by clicking the Settings button. You can also see scan reports and history of past system scans.

### Active Scanning

We both conducted a scan on a reasonably new Windows 10 system to check Hitman Pro and Malwarebytes’ effect on system resources. Both anti-malware programs ran smoothly during an active scan. There is no noticeable lag while using other applications. You can quickly open other programs while the security apps are running in the background.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3-2.png)

Both Hitman Pro and Malwarebytes employ “Smart Scan” method which scans all critical files in your system. Malwarebytes finished scanning in a little over four minutes; While Hitman Pro took 11 minutes and 29 seconds. However, Hitman Pro scanned a total of more than 1.5 million system objects.

On the other hand, Malwarebytes focused on more critical files and scanned around 280,000 objects in the computer. The two applications have the option for “Deep Scan” which scans your entire system and usually takes a while to finish.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Malware Detection and Removal

Malwarebytes have undergone testing through the AV-Comparatives program. The anti-malware, along with other security suites, was tested against several samples of ransomware and malware types. It [scored](https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/avc%5Fsp%5Fpcpitstop%5F201702%5Fen.pdf) decently in detecting malware with 99.2% accuracy. It is on the low-end when it comes to identifying ransomware at 95.1%. However, it did not raise any false alarms like other security applications.

Hitman Pro itself has no existing laboratory test results. It is because of its newer method of protection using cloud technology that makes it challenging to test. AV-Comparisons have just begun experimenting with similar security programs like Webroot. However, services used by Hitman Pro like G Data and Emsisoft have scored well in laboratory tests.

G Data was trialed alongside Malwarebytes in the [same test](https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/avc%5Fsp%5Fpcpitstop%5F201702%5Fen.pdf) and yielded 100% in detecting ransomware and malware. Additionally, Emsisoft gets an award by AV-Comparatives an Advanced+, the highest possible rating given by the laboratory, in File Detection. It also garnered an Advance rate regarding real-world protection test.

## Better Option – MalwareFox

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MalwareFox-1.jpg)

Hitman Pro and Malwarebytes are practical options for a secondary anti-malware application. [MalwareFox](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is a robust anti-malware program compared to the two. It works as a primary anti-malware suite which eliminates the need for a secondary software.

Download and installation are straightforward. With just around 5MB, even the most challenged connection can download a copy. Installation is quick and painless as well. MalwareFox balances the minimal but informative interface. Each window focuses on valuable information showing the protection of your system.

The anti-malware application packs a lot of features at its affordable price. The free version after the trial already scans, detects, and removes malware on your system efficiently. [Tests show](https://www.techchore.com/malwarefox-anti-malware-review/) that it can efficiently identify and eliminate threats. It does not take your system’s resources at all. MalwareFox even [proved](https://www.cravingtech.com/malwarefox-safe-tested-reviewed.html) to be more efficient than Windows Defender at catching real-time malicious activities.

It barely uses memory and processing power when it is idle. During an active scan, it will require a fair amount of computing power, but scanning takes less than 5 minutes.

It is powerful enough to protect your system from ransomware attacks. It catches and blocks even those still unknown threats. MalwareFox’s Zero Day Attack Protection analyzes suspicious files before it gets time to affect your computer.

MalwareFox even protects your browsing activities. It removes Adware, pop-ups, and toolbars which are potentially dangerous. It does not only protect your system but efficiently optimized it by eliminating unnecessary processes which hog memory.

## Final Thoughts

Considering the performance of popular anti-malware applications is essential. Your protection should be a top priority. Your chosen security system should not only detect and remove malicious files. It should also protect you while browsing before threats can even reach your machine. As they say, prevention is better than cure.

“Hitman Pro, along with its separate real-time protection Hitman.Alert,…”  
“Hitman.Alert”? What is that? The two processes running on my machine are labelled “HitmanPro.Alert” \[Copy/paste direct from the Process Hacker user interface.\]  
But then, although I installed HitmanPro.Alert before Sophos acquired SurfRight in 2015, I receive ongoing updates to HitmanPro.Alert without seeing any new labelling.  
“Meanwhile, the paid version of Hitman Pro only offers advanced malware removal and potentially unwanted application (PUA) removal. You will need to purchase the standalone HitmanPro.Alert for more real-time features… For some, this might be a good reason to pay the additional $34.95 on top of the standard version of Hitman Pro.”  
The choice is not between the paid version of HitmanPro \[US$ 24.95 (1 PC, 1 year)(March 2018)\], purchasing the standalone HitmanPro.Alert \[US$ 34.95 (1 PC, 1 year)(March 2018)\], or purchasing both as two separate items on the sales invoice \[US$ 24.95 + 34.95\]. “All the features found in HitmanPro are also included in HitmanPro.Alert”.

   Hi Fabionne,  
   Even MalwareFox may sometimes get tagged as malware by another security program.  
   It doesn’t mean that the application is malicious, it is more of false positive detection.  
   Do not worry and go ahead with its execution by adding the executing file to whitelist or exception of Malwarebytes.

         You can do an online scan at Virus Total for any file detected by your AV/Antimalware program to verify whether or not it really contains malware. Virus Total checks your file with multiple (and I mean multiple) antimalware programs. I have used it for many years.

Windows 10 Defender, Malwarebytes Lic. version (Premium) and Lic. version of Hitman pro make a strong pc security team for my 4 dell computers. Malwarefox certainly looks interesting and the price is good. Being a conservative retired combat vet I would stick with my team in place for now.

Have Malware Fox- Anti Malware installed on my 4 Dell computers. The Trial version is impressive. Since 3 Malwarebytes License’s are lifetime I will purchase a License for Malware Fox, my 4th license with Malwarebytes is a yearly subscription. Malware Fox is more economical and I like the simple interface. The PC I will use it on will have windows defender as my primary along with a licensed version of the HitMan Pro. For some reason I never cared for HitMan Pro Alert. Malware Fox is a great piece of software. Easy install easy to use. For what is worth in my opinion it is worth the price. Or just use the free version if money is an issue. In my case it will be installed on my PC that is used for banking so the license is for me.

Malwarebyte has proven to be adequate, however the ability to access customer service is a slow process with too long on chat to get a ticket to open and very slow response to the ticket. If you have a problem in installation or after installation you need to respond immediately, if not they will close your ticket prematurely. I suspect Maybe default users from Microsoft are sabotaging my account process by intercepting my communication with the Malwarebytes and causing events to force a password reset. Having to deal with accounts and all the BS hoops all the time sucks with any service. I think it would be worth paying a little more and getting better customer service. I am thinking of switching because of inattentive customer service.
