## Team Subscription licensing

The team subscription licensing is designed to provide scalability and flexibility. It is especially useful to all software engineering teams looking to simplify license compliance and procurement. 

As a result, we added all the attributes to the subscription model to ensure that you get the value you need, exactly when you need it.

About the **Team Subscription**:

\- It applies to all editions: Professional, Enterprise, and Architect. 

\- Includes all the software updates over the year.

\- It comes with:

* 5 concurrent users (each user connected up to five machines).
* Build servers included, for simplified licensing.
* Priority support.

\- Available to purchase only yearly.

## How does the Team Subscription license work?

The Advanced Installer tool allows users to install and use the software on multiple computers or devices. Every licensed user can be logged in on a maximum of 5 (five) devices simultaneously.

The Team Subscription enables 5 (five) users to use the application simultaneously - each user can connect to up to five machines or devices. Yes, that means you might have up to 25 devices connected to Advanced Installer.

For example, the **per-user** license can be used only by its developer-owner (it cannot be shared by multiple developers), and it allows the developer to register and use the application on up to five machines at the same time as long as he is the only one using the Advanced Installer application. 

Our EULA requires a license for every device that isn't run by a person and can access the software. That means you will need a license for automated build servers.

If the builds can be triggered by other developers, then you would need a license for each member of the team that works with Advanced Installer (creates, edits, or builds an installer project). If the builds are running independently on the server machine, e.g., there is no developer that can trigger a build, then you don't need a license for the developers.

## Registering with a Team Subscription

An Advanced Installer account is automatically created after your first purchase on www.advancedinstaller.com. Existing customers already have an account associated with the email address specified on the checkout page. All your subscriptions and licenses are associated with this account.

After you purchase a Team Subscription login into your [Advanced Installer account](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) and start adding new users in your team. Each user added into your team will automatically get access to a new account and the team license that you shared.

A team member now just needs to launch Advanced Installer, go to Start Page and select the option "Log in with your account", and enter the credentials received via email.

Advanced Installer will automatically register using the highest active edition available in their account.

## FAQ

* [What happened to the Floating license?](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)
* [I am using a legacy Floating license. Can I still use it?](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)
* [I am using a legacy Floating license. Can I buy another one?](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)
* [How do I upgrade or switch from a Floating license to a Team Subscription?](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)
* [What means “build servers included”?](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)
* [What is included in priority support?](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)

#### What happened to the Floating license?

The Floating license is no longer available to buy. Legacy Advanced Installer Floating users can continue using the license and purchase a new Maintenance Plan extension, or switch to the Team Subscription plan.

#### I am using a legacy Floating license. Can I still use it?

Yes, you can use it under the terms of the perpetual license.

#### I am using a legacy Floating license. Can I buy another one?

The only multi-user license available to buy online is the 5-user Team Subscription. Please contact us for any other types of licenses.

#### How do I upgrade or switch from a Floating license to a Team Subscription?

Please contact us at our support email address, and we will offer all the details.

#### What means “build servers included”?

All the perpetual licenses need to license the developer and the additional server/machine if there are builds that run independently (not triggered by a human user). The Team Subscription includes the licensing of all machines or servers that are used to build the application project, making you fully license compliant.

Subscription includes the licensing of all machines or servers that are used to build the application project, making you fully license compliant. 

As our [EULA](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) says, a non-human operated device is counted as a "User" in addition to all individuals authorized to use the Software, if such a device can access the Software. That means you will need to use license slot from your team for the build server.

If the builds can be triggered by developers, then you would need a license for each member of the team that works with Advanced Installer (creates, edits, or builds an installer project). If the builds are running independently on the server machine, e.g., there is no developer that can trigger a build, then you don't need a license for all the developers. Just the ones using Advanced Installer to edit and build the projects will need a license.

#### What is included in priority support?

Users with Team Subscriptions have priority access to the support team and can get technical help through a dedicated support email address. You will receive the email address immediately after buying the subscription.
