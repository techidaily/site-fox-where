This one time payment license continued until 2014\. After that, a new subscription model was introduced. It was annual plan which requires you to pay every 12 months.

If you previously purchased the premium product, then your license details should say the duration is for a lifetime. However, Malwarebytes program allows the new legitimate key to working on premium for 12 months, and not life anymore.

The new subscription model comes in a 12 months renewal form, and the cost of a renewal is determined by what type of license you have.

## Malwarebytes Lifetime License

A **Lifetime License** does not have a renewal cost as it was configured to be a PC license with no expiration date. There is no renewal fee to maintain the license. If you purchased your **Subscription License** originally at the lower legacy pricing, then your renewal price will be a special privilege. You will see no increase in your annual subscription rate.

For example, for a subscription renewal, if you purchased in August of 2014, you have a yearly 3 PC license for $24.95 a year (plus local taxes). After the release of Malwarebytes 3 premium, you are eligible for a free upgrade to Malwarebytes 3 premium and your renewal will remain $24.95.

I have just got this on my phone but as yet I haven’t paid any more to have the premium. I don’t know much about what apps are going to be the best one to protect your bank details and basically everything on your phone. Please advise on this
