### **The Decline in Phone’s Performance**

When any spyware or any other malware program infiltrates your device, your phone’s performance would suddenly decline. The smartphone would constantly hang and might even frequently shut down.

---

### **Increase in RAM Consumption**

The spyware hidden on your system will always be active in the background. This would increase the RAM consumption, and hence other apps would not get the required RAM amount to run.

---

### **Unusual Data Usage**

If you noticed that the internet data usage of your device has suddenly risen, even though you are using the internet as you do regularly, this might be because of a spyware app. The spyware applications might be using the internet to transfer your data to its source. The spyware might also use the internet to upgrade itself with new malicious codes. It requires a considerable amount and continuous flow of the internet.

---

### **Odd Sounds during Calls**

The modern cell phone networks are pretty advanced and very rarely get distorted. So, while on calls, if you get odd sounds or hear someone else’s voice other than the person you have called, it might be possible that your call is being secretly monitored and recorded.

### **The Battery is Draining Rapidly**

It is normal for an older phone to have diminished battery capacity. However, if your smartphone’s battery has suddenly started to drain rapidly, it might be because of the secret background activities going on your phone. Spyware programs work silently in the background, so they consume the battery power without showing any visible sign.

### **Phone getting hot**

You might experience your [phone getting hot](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) while playing games and performing other resource-consuming tasks. It is expected on modern phones, especially those with a metal finish. However, if your phone is heating up even without much heavy use, then probably the spyware silently working in the background is causing that.
