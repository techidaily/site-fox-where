### Spotting Suspicious Apps

Another method to detect potential spyware is to look for unfamiliar apps. Have you ever found an application on your iPhone and thought, “Did I download this?” If the answer is affirmative, you might be dealing with a harmful app. 

To verify, just navigate to Settings and it will display all the apps installed on your device. Any app unfamiliar or suspicious could indicate spyware.

### Inspecting App Permissions

Spyware is crafty. It often allows itself advanced permissions on your device, gaining access to your camera, microphone, files, and more. If you’ve identified a dubious app, the next step is to review its permissions. A rapid check can help you determine if any app has unnecessary access to your device.

### Verifying Device Profiles

Did you know that malicious profiles can sometimes be installed on your device, granting the attacker control over it? This may sound alarming, but there’s a way to check for this. Navigate to Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management (or VPN & Device Management for newer iOS versions). Any profiles that you don’t recognize should be deleted immediately.

### Monitoring Your Device’s Activity

Lastly, but most importantly, keep a close eye on your device’s activity. Unexplained changes in battery usage, data consumption, or CPU usage might indicate the presence of spyware. To check your battery and data usage, go to Settings > Battery and Settings > Cellular. For CPU usage, third-party apps like [System Status](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/system-status-hw-monitor/id407752428) are available.

If all of the above fails, you will have to transfer or reset iPhone to get rid of threats.

## Signs of Spyware on iPhone

### The Battery Drain Game

Have you noticed your iPhone’s battery level decreasing at an unusually rapid pace? That’s not merely you progressing through another level of Candy Crush. A rapidly depleting battery could signal that your iPhone is overworking due to unwanted spyware. Yes, your phone could be working round the clock even when you’re not, and here’s why. Spyware operates covertly, 24/7, tracking your digital activity. So, if your battery is depleting faster than usual, and it’s not due to those viral TikTok videos, it’s time to check for spyware.

### The Need for Speed (or Lack Thereof)

Ever find your iPhone operating as if it’s stuck in a time warp? The lag in performance could be more than just an irritating interruption in your social media scrolling. It could be a sign of spyware. While it’s true that overheating and a quick-draining battery often accompany lagging performance, the slow speed alone can be a tell-tale sign. Learning how to check for spyware on your iPhone could not only speed up your digital life but also fortify your security. 

### Data Depletion Dilemma

Spyware is the uninvited guest that not only disrupts your party but also inflates your bill. It uses your mobile data to transmit the information it collects about you. This implies that your data package is not just for your Instagram updates and Spotify playlists anymore. If you find your data disappearing faster than your morning coffee, you might be unknowingly funding a cyber stalker’s party.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### The Uninvited App Activity

Finally, keep a lookout for suspicious activity, such as random apps opening or closing without your command. Ever heard unexpected background noise during phone calls? Or received gibberish SMS text messages? What about strange texts being sent from your phone that you don’t remember typing? All these are like unwanted guests in your digital living room, potentially indicating the presence of spyware.

### Keeping iOS Updated: Your First Line of Defense

Ever wondered why Apple keeps releasing iOS updates so frequently? Apart from adding new features or fixing minor bugs, these updates often include crucial patches to security exploits. In the cyber world, outdated software is like an open invitation to hackers. According to a report, [outdated software increases the risk of a security breach](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/unpatched-vulnerabilities-the-source-of-most-data-breaches) by an astonishing 60%. So, prompt updates can be your first line of defense against spyware. Don’t hesitate to click that ‘Update Now’ button – it’s for your own safety!

### The Power of Strong Passwords

Strong passwords are the superheroes of your cyber world. They protect your personal data from the villainous grasp of spyware. But what makes a “strong” password? Ideally, it should be a unique combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Tools like Passfault can assist you in checking the strength of your passwords. Remember, a good password is like a good joke. If it’s too easy to figure out, it’s not doing its job right!

### Jailbreaking: A Shortcut To Vulnerability

While jailbreaking your iOS device may offer you some additional freedom, it’s akin to playing with fire. In the cybersecurity world, jailbreaking is frowned upon as it exposes your device to all sorts of vulnerabilities. A study shows that[jailbroken devices are more prone to malware](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10193328/). So, consider carefully before you decide to jailbreak your device. After all, security should always supersede convenience.

### Securing Your Wi-Fi Network: The Invisible Shield

Your Wi-Fi network is the digital gateway to your device. If it’s unprotected, it’s like leaving your front door wide open for intruders. A secured wireless network, on the other hand, acts like an invisible shield, repelling unwanted guests. So, [how do you secure it](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)? Use a strong password, enable network encryption, and keep your router’s firmware updated. Keep your digital doorway locked!
